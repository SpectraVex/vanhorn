NO NEED TO DYNAMICALLY REALLOC ANYTHING, FROM ARRAYS TO RESOURCES OR ANYTHING, EVERYTHING IS LOW FIDELITY SO MAX RUNTIME MEM FOOTPRINT WOULD BE LIKE 50-100MB.
BETWEEN LEVEL LOADING, WE CAN THEN DO DEALLOCATIONS OF RESOURCES AND DESTROYING OF ARRAYS AND SUCH, THEN JUST SET UP ARRAYS AND RESOURCES FOR LEVEL X, AND SO FORTH.

FIXED-SIZED RESOURCE DESIGN SYSTEM WIDE FOR THIS GAME.
GLOBAL STATIC STACK-ONLY RESOURCES ON BOOT.
I THINK THIS METHOD IS CALLED OBJECT POOLING.
